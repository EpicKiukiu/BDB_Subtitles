1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,840
What's your name?

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,470
Wrath.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,260
I'm here to take care of you.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,140
Killing ordinary vampires

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,800
is only slightly more difficult

6
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,140
than killing a human.

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,930
But the Black Dagger Brotherhood,

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,980
their Scribe Virgin has bred them

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,900
to be monstrously strong.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,180
I've made some important progress.

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,610
I'm going to set you free
from that assassin.

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,740
Don't talk about Wrath like that.

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,370
Where are we headed?

14
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,000
I thought we'd have
a little friendly competition.

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,120
Police, halt!

16
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,380
Let me see your hands.

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,840
I'm here to save her.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,090
Let him go!

19
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,260
You're about to get sick, Beth. And
I'm the only one who can help you.

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,800
Who was my father?

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,010
He was as I am.

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,350
- What...
- Beth, listen to me.

23
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,850
What, so you can tell me
you're a fucking vampire?

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,230
Don't tell me that I'm going...

25
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,650
What's gonna happen to me?

26
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,440
Change is going to come fast.

27
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,530
It hits all of us sometime
around our 25th birthday.

28
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,910
Can I stop this from happening?

29
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,790
No.

30
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,120
You better take cover, son.

31
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,890
Billy.

32
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,980
Pretty good job tonight.
Played the game well, son.

33
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,680
Until just now.

34
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,940
Thank you, Sensei.

35
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,310
Game over.

36
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:40,489
I'm gonna get ugly wasted tonight.
You shouldn't stick around.

37
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,410
Nah. I'll hang and see it through.

38
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:44,489
Then I'll drag you back
into your apartment.

39
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,200
Watch you throw up for an hour,
and push you into bed.

40
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,459
Before I leave, I'll get
the coffee machine set up.

41
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,080
Aspirin will be right next
to the sugar bowl.

42
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,590
- I don't have a sugar bowl.
- Then it'll be next to the bag.

43
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,090
- You'd make a great wife, Jos�.
- That's what mine tells me.

44
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,840
Throwing stars I
peeled off that suspect.

45
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,719
Same as the ones we found at the car
bombing and around Cherry's body.

46
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,970
No prints.

47
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,020
Get them off the internet
for about 12 bucks a pop.

48
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,520
The other weapons?

49
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,440
Flashy set of daggers,
no identifying manufacturer.

50
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:18,319
Standard nine-millimeter guns
with the serial numbers filed off.

51
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,360
But the freaky thing was, bullets.

52
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,160
Never seen anything like 'em.

53
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,080
Hollowed, filled with
some kind of liquid.

54
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,450
The boys think it's just water,
but why would someone do that?

55
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,680
You gotta be kiddin' me.

56
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,420
No prints?

57
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,920
He's a real professional.

58
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,260
Doesn't sound what you
call real homegrown.

59
00:05:39,261 --> 00:05:42,589
We're going over ballistics on the guns
and checking the money to see if it's hot.

60
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,179
First thing in the morning, we'll
give the NYC boys everything we got,

61
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,010
but it's not gonna be much.

62
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,220
If anything happens to Beth...

63
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,930
We'll find him.

64
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,850
God help him if he hurts her.

65
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,320
God help him.

66
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,650
He's not my lover.

67
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,740
Butch, the cop.

68
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,820
He's not, so...

69
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,870
if you see him
again, don't kill him.

70
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,880
Okay.

71
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,800
You really didn't mean to
sleep with me last night, did you?

72
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,430
No, I didn't.

73
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,680
So why did you?

74
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,100
Because I had to.

75
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,820
Why?

76
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,620
You made me realize how cold I am.

77
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,930
I liked warming you.

78
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,930
I liked the feel of you.

79
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,240
Look, I want you to crash here,
but I've gotta take off.

80
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,580
Why?

81
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,740
Are you running away?

82
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,160
Be careful, Beth.

83
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,920
Why?

84
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,880
Because I'm about
to crack over here.

85
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,190
Are you gonna tell me no?

86
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,030
I don't wanna take
advantage of you.

87
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,240
You've been through
enough tonight.

88
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,250
I'm angry.

89
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,540
Scared. Confused.

90
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,420
I want you to make love to me
until I don't feel,

91
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,180
until I'm numb.

92
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,890
If anything, I'd be using you.

93
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,480
Fuck, that sounds awful.

94
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,050
Don't leave, Wrath.

95
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,300
And don't say no.

96
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,950
Wrath. Wrath, are you
okay? What's wrong?

97
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,530
Are you all right?

98
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,290
Are you all right?

99
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,530
What happened? What did I do?

100
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,740
Beth, leave me.

101
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,490
Get the fuck back!

102
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,170
You get any closer,
I'm going to bite you.

103
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,300
Got it?

104
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,880
You wouldn't hurt me.

105
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,130
Get dressed. Go upstairs.

106
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,170
Ask Fritz to take you home.

107
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,220
I'll send Tohr to watch over you.

108
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,430
But I don't want to leave. I...

109
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,800
You have to.

110
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,890
Beth, please. It hurts.

111
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,900
I don't know how long
I can hold myself back.

112
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,200
Go.

113
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,540
Marissa.

114
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,420
Marissa!

115
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,210
- Thank you. I live at...
- I know where you live.

116
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,880
We've always known where you were.

117
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,470
First, at Saint Francis Hospital
in Neonatal Intensive Care.

118
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,470
Then you went home with a nurse.

119
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,299
We thought the nurse
was going to keep you,

120
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,100
but then the hospital
made her give you back.

121
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,640
And then you went into the system,
and we didn't like that.

122
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:34,439
First, you were assigned to the
McWilliams on Elmwood Avenue.

123
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,900
But then you became ill.

124
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,330
Then went back to the hospital
with pneumonia.

125
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,500
After that, you went to the Ryans,

126
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,120
but there were too many children.

127
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,790
Then you went to the Goldriches,

128
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,040
who lived on that split-level
off Raleigh Street.

129
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,960
We thought the Goldriches
were going to keep you,

130
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,090
but then she became pregnant.

131
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,300
And, finally, to that orphanage.

132
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,300
Oh, we hated that you were there

133
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,970
because they didn't let you out
to play enough.

134
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,310
You keep saying we.

135
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,980
Yes. Your father and I.

136
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,320
He knew me?

137
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,240
Oh, yes, mistress. All along.

138
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,660
Kindergarten and elementary school
and high school.

139
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:29,449
Oh, we were so proud of you when you went
to college on that academic scholarship.

140
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,290
I was there when you graduated.

141
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,500
Took pictures so
your father could see.

142
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,840
He knew me.

143
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,880
We have every column
you've ever written.

144
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:42,509
When you started
at the Caldwell Courier Journal,

145
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,509
your father refused to go
to sleep in the morning

146
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,009
until after I'd brought
him the paper.

147
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,640
No matter how hard his night
might have been,

148
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,600
he would not rest
until he read what you wrote.

149
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,140
He was so, so proud of you.

150
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,400
Oh, here.

151
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,360
Now, you must understand how hard it
was for him to stay away from you.

152
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Families of warriors
must be guarded carefully,

153
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,790
and you were unprotected
because you were raised human.

154
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,080
And he'd also hoped that
you'd be spared the transition.

155
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,290
- Did you know my mother?
- Not well.

156
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,340
She disappeared when she found out
he wasn't human.

157
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,800
She didn't tell him
she was pregnant.

158
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,300
And it was only
when she was about to give birth

159
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,890
that she reached out to him.

160
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,680
I think she was scared of what
she was bringing into the world.

161
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,400
Unfortunately, she went into labor

162
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,110
and was taken to a human hospital
before we could get to her.

163
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:45,110
But you should know
that he loved her very deeply.

164
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,370
My father and Wrath,

165
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,750
they were close?

166
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,830
Your father loved Wrath.

167
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,170
We all do. He's our king.

168
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,340
The king?

169
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,720
That's why your
father sent him to you.

170
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,180
And here we are.

171
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,480
Neither your father nor I approved
of you living in a ground floor unit.

172
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,700
May I ask you more later?

173
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,870
Oh, mistress, yes please. There's
so much I want to tell you.

174
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,420
My Lord?

175
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,650
I need...

176
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,180
Wrath.

177
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,770
My Lord, you need to feed.

178
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,230
Here, take my wrist.

179
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,360
Oh, hey, Boo.

180
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,240
Hey, sweetie. Who's a good kitty?

181
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,440
Hey, Boo.

182
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,370
Beth?

183
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,490
I'm Tohrment. A friend of Wrath.

184
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,710
You can call me Tohr.

185
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,710
I'm here to hang for a while.

186
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,300
I'll be right outside
if you need anything.

187
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,340
Wait. Why don't you...

188
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,390
Please come in.

189
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,680
Okay.

190
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,200
Would you like
something to drink or...

191
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,990
You got any beer?

192
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,750
Yeah. Actually, I think I do.

193
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,010
I'm glad I finally met you.

194
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,430
Your father talked
about you a lot.

195
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,940
Oatmeal raisin? My favorite.

196
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:07,020
I thought that vampires
only drink blood.

197
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,590
No. Necessary nutrients in it,
but we need food too.

198
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,720
Garlic?

199
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,880
Bring it on.

200
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,640
You are not like Wrath.

201
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,470
No one's like Wrath.

202
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,890
He's a... force of nature.

203
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,350
And he's deadly.

204
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,650
There's no one
who will take better care of you.

205
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,150
How do you know?

206
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,200
He marked you.

207
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,870
I can smell it.

208
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,040
The warning's all over you,
as if you were his shellan.

209
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,540
His what?

210
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,540
His mate. That scent on your skin sends
a powerful message to other males.

211
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:58,680
You don't mind, do you, being his?

212
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:06,720
Do you have a wife... or a mate?

213
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,860
Shellan.

214
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,440
Wellsie. We were promised to
each other before our transitions.

215
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,980
It was dumb luck
that we fell in love.

216
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,200
Some males take
more than one shellan,

217
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,450
but I can't imagine being
with another female.

218
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,450
Does Wrath have a shellan?

219
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,550
I think you better
talk to him about that.

220
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,580
You wanna watch something?

221
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,460
Yeah.

222
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,300
I think the new Godzilla's out.

223
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,260
Sweet. I always
root for the monster.

224
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,760
Me too.

225
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,070
Marissa.

226
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,900
My Lord...

227
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,540
I release you...
from the covenant.

228
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,080
You are free of me.

229
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,470
Shit.

230
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,010
This is what you've always wanted
and I grant it to you now.

231
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,720
Marissa.

232
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,220
Please, don't say the words.

233
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,100
I cannot bear to hear the truth
from your lips,

234
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,810
even though I know it well.

235
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,900
You've always been ashamed
to be tied to me.

236
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,780
This isn't about you.

237
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,460
I know.

238
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,210
I saw the female...

239
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,880
in your mind.

240
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm sorry.

241
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,010
Just be sorry that it took
this long for me to see

242
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,640
what has always been true.

243
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,440
I will still protect you.

244
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:22,940
No...

245
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,240
you won't.

246
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,040
I'm no longer your concern,

247
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,620
not that I've ever been.

248
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,240
Yeah?

249
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,700
Good morning, sunshine.

250
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,960
Time?

251
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:11,330
Eleven o'clock.
Thought you might wanna know

252
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,330
that Beth just called here
looking for you.

253
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,750
- And the guy?
- Didn't mention him.

254
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,000
But she did say she wanted
to talk to you sometime today.

255
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,919
I canceled the APB out on her
'cause she was calling from home.

256
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,919
Told her you were tied up
until this afternoon.

257
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,220
- Coming in now.
- I wouldn't do that.

258
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,390
Internal Affairs has showed up here
asking about you and Billy Riddle.

259
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:35,599
Captain's gunning for your ass and
you're in no position to run into him.

260
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,230
Sober up.
I left some aspirin by the phone.

261
00:24:38,231 --> 00:24:40,229
Figured you aren't gonna make it
to the coffee pot.

262
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:43,520
Take three,
turn your ringer off, and sleep.

263
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,440
Anything exciting happens,
I'll come and get you.

264
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,780
- Love you, honey.
- Then buy me a mink

265
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,159
and a nice pair of earrings
for our anniversary.

266
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,210
You got it.

267
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,380
What happened?

268
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,870
Suspended without pay
pending the conclusion

269
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,600
of an internal investigation
and... they'll officially can me.

270
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,100
- Told you not to come in, man.
- I had to.

271
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,020
That Riddle guy deserved worse.

272
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,100
NYPD, what'd they
find out on a suspect?

273
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,610
Nada. It's like he
came out of nowhere.

274
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,530
Those stars. They've been
bought locally too, right?

275
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,700
Yeah. Sure.

276
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,950
- Through Martial Arts Academies.
- Yeah.

277
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,660
- I'll see you.
- We already sent someone to go ask around.

278
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,660
No one remembers seeing the guy.

279
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,170
Christ, Butch,
this won't bring your sister back.

280
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,250
You wanna kick me in the nuts too?

281
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,630
Just don't... just don't push
your luck out there, detective.

282
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,380
Pushing's all I know
how to do, Jos�.

283
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,010
Detective O'Neal,

284
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,600
I hear you're doing
some kind of investigation.

285
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,400
How exciting.
I'm completely at your disposal.

286
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,400
Hey.

287
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,160
Hard at work, Randall?

288
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,330
Always.

289
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,420
You know, I heard a rumor

290
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,170
that you went out with that
homicide detective, O'Neal.

291
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,340
So?

292
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,010
So good job.

293
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,890
Work a little magic on him.
See what you can get.

294
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,220
Might wanna do a cover story

295
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:23,020
on police brutality with him
as a poster child.

296
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,860
And I just might be persuaded
to promote you.

297
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,570
Beth Randall.

298
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,320
Mistress, are you all right?

299
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,580
- Sorry. Yes, I'm fine.
- Well, I probably shouldn't have called

300
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,960
but I didn't want you
to be unprepared.

301
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,000
Master has requested a special
dinner for you and him, alone.

302
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,920
Well, I thought I might pick you
up and we could find you a dress.

303
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,680
I know it's presumptuous of me.
He's going to call you himself.

304
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,100
Mistress?

305
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,230
I would love to
get a dress, Fritz.

306
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,730
I would absolutely love to.

307
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,020
Thanks.

308
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,410
- Hello?
- Beth.

309
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,200
- Marissa.
- I thought I would join you.

310
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,620
I would be very pleased
to have your company.

311
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,840
How is your work?

312
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,340
My work? Fine.

313
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,010
Actually, it's better than fine.

314
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,430
As I mentioned,
I had a bit of a breakthrough.

315
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,980
Feeding may soon
be a thing of the past.

316
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,020
I transfused myself
with stored blood this afternoon,

317
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,230
and I feel fine.

318
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,990
You still miss
Evangeline, don't you?

319
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,530
Painfully.

320
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,200
And drinking from
another is simply not...

321
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,370
agreeable to me.

322
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,660
I'm sorry.

323
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,840
I'm sorry that I've
been so preoccupied

324
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,050
these past many years,

325
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,760
but it will be better now.

326
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,400
Yes.

327
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:28,140
You could try the
transfusion as well.

328
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,690
It will free you too.

329
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,690
I would like to try it.

330
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,440
Drinking is no longer palatable
to me either.

331
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,450
Truly?

332
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:42,490
Yes.

333
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,200
Truly.

334
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,340
How could Wrath
have treated you so roughly?

335
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,420
It's nothing. Let's eat.

336
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,560
How can I?

337
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,100
Because it's over.

338
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,350
I have broken the
covenant with Wrath.

339
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,640
I will see him no more.

340
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,820
He has found another
female who he wants.

341
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,280
And just who does
he prefer to you?

342
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,780
You do not know her.

343
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,620
She's human. Or, at least, half human,
from what I can tell from his thoughts.

344
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,950
Has the Scribe
Virgin been contacted?

345
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,580
That is his duty, not mine.

346
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,540
But make no mistake.

347
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,380
He will go to her.

348
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:42,050
It is over.

349
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,940
- Butch?
- Hey. Got time to talk?

350
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,110
- Not right now.
- Where you going?

351
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,240
I have a date.

352
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,610
- With who?
- If you'll excuse me...

353
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,460
What happened to the man
last night, Beth? Where is he?

354
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,410
- Oh, fuck. Beth, don't do this.
- Let go of me, Butch.

355
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,500
- He's dangerous.
- And you aren't?

356
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,000
Tomorrow, let's talk after work.

357
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:21,010
- Beth, I can't let you.
- Are you gonna arrest me?

358
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,140
No.

359
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,090
Thank you.

360
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,800
Beth, please.

361
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,260
Nothing is as it seems.

362
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,730
No. I got a pretty clear fucking picture.
You're protecting a killer, Beth.

363
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,480
There's a serious chance you're
gonna get stuffed into a pine box.

364
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,650
I saw the look on his face

365
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:44,040
when his hand was around my neck
squeezing the life right out of me.

366
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,410
A man like that's got
murder in his blood.

367
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,330
It's in his nature.

368
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,990
How can you go to him?

369
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:53,079
Hell, how can you let him
walk these streets?

370
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,080
- He's not like that. I...
- Mistress?

371
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,880
Is there a difficulty?

372
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,840
No, Fritz. No problem.

373
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,800
Tomorrow, Butch.

374
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,760
- Meet me here tomorrow.
- If you live that long.

375
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,510
Fuck.

376
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,520
Wrath, man.

377
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,400
Look at you.

378
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,770
Bite me.

379
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,030
No, thank you. I prefer females.

380
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,940
Although, you've cleaned up nice.

381
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,660
You're here why?

382
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:13,200
You said you want us
to meet here tonight.

383
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,290
I'm busy until midnight.

384
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,210
I'll tell the Brothers
to be ready then.

385
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,340
And Wrath...

386
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,380
What?

387
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,180
You're way into her.
I think she feels the same way.

388
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:36,180
I'm only hanging in until she goes
through the change. That's it.

389
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:41,020
Darius told me you turned him down
when he asked you to take care of her.

390
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,690
- What changed your mind?
- He's dead.

391
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,980
- I owe him.
- You owed him when he was alive.

392
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:51,030
I'm not talking about her
to you or anyone else. Got it?

393
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,870
And keep your mouth shut
with the Brothers.

394
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,540
Okay. Okay.

395
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,210
But do yourself a favor and
cope to what's going on with her.

396
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,540
An unacknowledged
weakness is deadly.

397
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,960
Weakness?

398
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,760
This coming from a male who's
dumb enough to love his shellan.

399
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,680
I am lucky to have found love.

400
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,430
I thank the Scribe Virgin every
day that Wellsie's in my life.

401
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,940
- You're pathetic.
- You've been dead for hundreds of years.

402
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:25,359
You're just too mean
to find a grave and lie down.

403
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,320
At least, I'm not pussy-whipped.

404
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,530
Nice fucking suit.

405
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,430
If you spent half the amount
of time defending our race

406
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,170
that you do chasing
after that female of yours,

407
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,840
we might not have lost Darius.

408
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,260
Ever think of that?

409
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,470
Fuck you, you arrogant asshole.

410
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,810
You better learn
who your enemies really are

411
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,310
before you find
yourself standing alone.

412
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:05,099
I'll serve the first course
in 30 minutes, shall I?

413
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,290
No. We'll sit down now.

414
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,500
As you wish, Master. Right away.

415
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,640
You look...

416
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,390
different in those clothes.

417
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,140
If you think they've civilized me,
don't be fooled.

418
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,940
I'm not.

419
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,070
Good.

420
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,900
Now, let's get this over with.

421
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,840
Why were you so late?

422
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,180
Did Fritz have to
talk you into coming?

423
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,140
It was nothing like that.

424
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,800
Butch followed us. We had
to wait 'till we got free of him.

425
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,120
Wine?

426
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,390
Why are you afraid of me now?

427
00:37:49,391 --> 00:37:53,729
You walked into this house
scared of me again.

428
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,649
Before you even saw me,
you were frightened.

429
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,900
I wanna know why.

430
00:37:56,901 --> 00:38:00,699
Maybe I was reminded that last night
you almost killed a friend of mine.

431
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,160
Christ. Not that again.

432
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,290
You asked.

433
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,699
Don't get mad
if you don't like the answer.

434
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,910
I didn't kill him, did I?

435
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,099
Only because I stopped you.

436
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,710
And that bothers you?

437
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,620
Most people like to be heroes.

438
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:16,129
You know what? I don't wanna
be here with you right now.

439
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,880
- So why did you come?
- Because you asked me to.

440
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,640
Believe me.

441
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,760
I can handle the rejection.

442
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,810
This was a mistake.

443
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,310
Sit down.

444
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,150
Do not tell me what to do.

445
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,190
Let me amend that.

446
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,900
Sit down and shut up.

447
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,950
You arrogant asshole.

448
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:42,819
Someone's already
called me that tonight.

449
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,200
Thank you very much.

450
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,570
Where do you get off talking
to me like that?

451
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,260
Let's get one thing straight.

452
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,390
You need me.

453
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:10,679
So get over your hang-ups about
what I might have done to that cop.

454
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,910
Your good buddy Butch
is still above ground.

455
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,310
So what's the problem?

456
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,190
How can life mean
so little to you?

457
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,700
How can death mean so much to you?

458
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,160
I'd really like to go,
if you don't mind.

459
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,670
Hell, this isn't right.

460
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,790
No, it isn't.

461
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,420
I thought you deserved a...

462
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,890
I don't know, a date or something.

463
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,510
Something normal.

464
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,520
Dumb idea, I know.

465
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,860
I should stick to
what I'm good at.

466
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,070
I'd be better off
teaching you how to kill.

467
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,920
Look...

468
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,380
I fight to protect,

469
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,260
not because I've got
a jones for murder,

470
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,260
but I've killed thousands, Beth.

471
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,600
So if you want me to pretend
I'm not comfortable with death,

472
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,180
I can't do that for you.

473
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,100
Thousands?

474
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,730
Who are you fighting?

475
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:42,070
Bastards would kill you as soon
as you go through the transition.

476
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,900
Vampire hunters?

477
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,040
Lessers.

478
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:51,990
Humans who have traded their souls to
the Omega for a free reign of terror.

479
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,120
The Omega, like the devil?

480
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,330
Worse.

481
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:02,250
Vampires were created
by the Scribe Virgin,

482
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,300
her chosen children.

483
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,760
The Omega resented her ability
to generate life,

484
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,970
despised the special powers
she gave to our species.

485
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,520
The Lessening Society
was his response.

486
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,560
He uses humans
because he's incapable of creation

487
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,280
and because they are a readily
available source of aggression.

488
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,570
You have others
who fight with you?

489
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,160
My brothers.

490
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,820
Vampires recognized
we were under siege.

491
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,990
The strongest males were chosen,

492
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,210
trained to fight,
turned loose against the Lessers.

493
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:42,250
Those warriors were bred through the
strongest females over generations

494
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,260
until a separate subspecies
of vampires emerged.

495
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,930
The most powerful were indoctrinated
into the Black Dagger Brotherhood.

496
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,600
Are you brothers by blood?

497
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,230
In a matter of speaking.

498
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,150
Thank you.

499
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,500
When you went
after Butch like that,

500
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,460
surely he's not a... lesser.

501
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,920
He tried to keep me from you.

502
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,890
I will level anyone
before I'd let that happen.

503
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,880
You don't like...

504
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,430
us, do you?

505
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,980
Humans are threatened
by anything different.

506
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,770
They're bullies.

507
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,060
It's them, Beth, not us.

508
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,150
You are not wholly
human right now,

509
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,280
and soon you won't
be human at all.

510
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,450
Why aren't you eating?

511
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,660
You need food.

512
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,660
You wanna be as strong as possible
for the change.

513
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,260
Wrath?

514
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,610
What?

515
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,400
- Fritz?
- Right here, Master.

516
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,360
We need red.

517
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,610
You have something else to ask me?

518
00:44:58,780 --> 00:44:59,830
Beth?

519
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,580
Yeah.

520
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:06,620
Is it true that you can't go out
in the daytime?

521
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,500
Vampires do not do sunlight.

522
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:14,340
Second to third degree burns will
immediately pop up upon exposure.

523
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,550
Incineration occurs
not long after.

524
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,890
The sun is not something
you wanna screw with.

525
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,470
But I can. I...

526
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,930
You haven't gone
through the change.

527
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,100
Afterwards,
you might be able to tolerate it.

528
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:32,520
Vampire characteristics can be diluted
for people who have a human parent.

529
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,990
Then again, Darius' blood
is strong in your veins.

530
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,120
How often will I need to...

531
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:45,710
feed?

532
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,370
In the beginning, fairly often.

533
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,920
Maybe twice, three times a month.

534
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,710
There's no way of knowing.

535
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:58,300
After you help me
through this the first time,

536
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,640
how will I be able
to find a man that...

537
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,180
I'll take care of
finding you someone.

538
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,430
Until then, you will use me.

539
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,320
Hopefully, that won't be for long.

540
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,940
So eager for someone else?

541
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,690
No. I just thought...

542
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,700
Fritz said that you were
king of the vampires.

543
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,530
I thought that would
make you busy.

544
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,240
He's gotta learn to zip it.

545
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,290
Is it true that you're the king?

546
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,210
No.

547
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,210
Are you married?

548
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,800
Do you have a wife or a mate,
or two, a woman in your life?

549
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,130
Christ, no.

550
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:41,130
Then who do you feed from?

551
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,560
There was someone.

552
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,020
We were never close.
It was a bad match.

553
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,270
- Who do you go to now?
- God!

554
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,480
You really are a
reporter, aren't you?

555
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:57,650
Who?

556
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,620
When was the last time you fed?

557
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,920
Last night.

558
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,550
But you didn't bite me.

559
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:20,340
It was after you left.

560
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,300
You don't like that, do you?

561
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,020
Me drinking from another female?

562
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,270
- Do you wanna rub my nose in it?
- No.

563
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,520
God, Beth.

564
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,940
I wanted it to be you.

565
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,700
The idea that you will someday score
another male's skin with your teeth,

566
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,830
and take his blood inside of you

567
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,830
makes me wanna stab something.

568
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,670
But I can't let
myself think like that.

569
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:58,880
Why not?

570
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,920
Because you cannot be mine.

571
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,380
No matter what I said before.

572
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,230
Here,

573
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,140
let me feed you.

574
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,280
Did you have sex
with her when you fed?

575
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,450
No.

576
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:12,200
And let me answer
your next question.

577
00:49:12,290 --> 00:49:15,290
I'm not sleeping with anyone
but you right now.

578
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,460
Let me feed you.

579
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,510
Please.

580
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:02,920
Come with me.

581
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,690
Wrath. Okay.

582
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,360
Wait, wait.

583
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,730
Do you have any condoms?

584
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:25,870
No. Why?

585
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,200
Ever hear of safe sex?

586
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,030
Vampires are not susceptible
to human viruses,

587
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,080
and you're not fertile.

588
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,830
But how do you know that?

589
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,790
We'd both know if you are.

590
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,300
God.

591
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,430
What?

592
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,510
What?

593
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,550
To think of you
going through the needing...

594
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,810
to be the one you used.

595
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,940
But that will be some
other male's duty.

596
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,570
And privilege.

597
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,520
I wanna see your eyes.

598
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,900
You can be hard to read
with those glasses on. And...

599
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,700
right now, I wouldn't mind
knowing what you're thinking.

600
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:30,320
You're blind, aren't you?

601
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,360
Worried that I can't
take care of you now?

602
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,000
No.

603
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,750
I'd like to see your eyes.

604
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,390
Beautiful.

605
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,940
Useless.

606
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,280
Beautiful.

607
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,620
Have they always been like this?

608
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,700
I was born visually impaired.

609
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:30,500
My sight got worse
after my transition...

610
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,380
and will probably
degenerate even more...

611
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,380
as I age.

612
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,980
So you can see some things.

613
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:49,900
Yeah.

614
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,150
I know that I like your hair down.

615
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:09,500
And I know you are very beautiful.

616
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:26,480
Sight is seriously overrated.

617
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,350
Touch...

618
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,360
taste...

619
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:39,950
smell are just as important.

620
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,550
All I have to do is smell you.

621
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,480
Beth...

622
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:13,810
sweet heaven.

623
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:40,130
I wouldn't let Fritz change the
sheets on the bed after you left.

624
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,180
I wanted to smell you
when I lay down in them.

625
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,580
I've been too greedy with you.

626
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,290
I really haven't taken
you properly yet.

627
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:16,840
I'm not so sure about that.

628
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:27,940
More.

629
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,140
I want more.

630
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,730
And you'll get it.

631
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,870
Do you wanna know
what you taste like?

632
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,720
You taste like peaches.

633
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,090
And I love peaches.

634
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:35,690
