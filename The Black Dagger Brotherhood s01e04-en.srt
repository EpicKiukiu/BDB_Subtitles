1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,130
You sensed that something is
coming, something monumental.

2
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:07,509
You're about to get sick, Beth, and
I'm the only one who can help you.

3
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,510
I transfused myself
with stored blood this afternoon,

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,970
and I feel fine.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,510
I would like to try it.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,480
Drinking is no longer palatable
to me either.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,890
No one's like Wrath.
And he's deadly.

8
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:20,939
There's no one
who will take better care of you.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,270
- How do you know?
- He marked you.

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,360
The warning's all over you
as if you were a shellan.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,570
If you spent half the amount
of time defending our race

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,370
that you do chasing
after that female of yours,

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,080
we might not have lost Darius.

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
Fuck you, you arrogant asshole.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,330
- What happened?
- Suspended without pay

16
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,880
pending the conclusion of
an internal investigation and...

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,630
they'll officially can me.

18
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,420
Vampires were created
by the Scribe Virgin.

19
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,220
The strongest males were chosen.

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,640
Those warriors were bred through the
strongest females over generations

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,560
until a separate subspecies
of vampires emerged.

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,560
The most powerful were indoctrinated
into the Black Dagger Brotherhood.

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,400
Who are you fighting?

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,730
Lessers.

25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,070
Humans who have traded their souls to
the Omega for free reign of terror.

26
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,120
I'd like to see your eyes.

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,990
Beautiful.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,240
Useless.

29
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,840
Beautiful.

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,380
I have broken the
covenant with Wrath.

31
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,890
He has found another
female who he wants.

32
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,770
She's human... or,
at least, half human.

33
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,480
But make no mistake,

34
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,400
he will go to her.

35
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,860
And as for the brotherhood, well,
I hate that they have to exist.

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,910
Oh, God.

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,210
Oh, God.

38
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,240
Will you stay?

39
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,030
I'm not sure I can walk right now.

40
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,300
Where are you going?

41
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,020
I'm meeting with my brothers.

42
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,770
Then we're going out.

43
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,570
Fritz will be here.

44
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,990
Stay.

45
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,860
I'll return before dawn.

46
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,750
You're going to fight?

47
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,250
- But you're...
- Blind? Yes.

48
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,340
And I've been blind for 300 years.

49
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,380
Three hundred years?

50
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,260
Well...

51
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,470
gotta say you're
holding up just fine.

52
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,190
How long will I live?

53
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,580
Hey, Wrath.

54
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,740
Hey, Wrath, I can't breathe.

55
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,510
You didn't answer my question.

56
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,520
I don't know the answer.

57
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,070
Well...

58
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,750
however long I've got,
I wish you'd stay with me tonight.

59
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,630
Yo, Wrath? We're all here.

60
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,380
Will you be here when I get back?

61
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,270
I don't know.

62
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,060
It would be safer if you stay.

63
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,490
The change.

64
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,160
You'll need me.

65
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,930
The other door out in the hall,

66
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,810
it opens to your father's bedroom.

67
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,500
- You know her?
- Another one of Big Daddy's.

68
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,250
Carla Rizzoli, AKA Candy.

69
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,920
- Same MO?
- Yup. Throat slit, blood everywhere.

70
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:44,169
There was some residue on her lips
like she was foaming at the mouth.

71
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,379
Medical examiner is gonna do an
autopsy first thing in the morning.

72
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,890
- Anything found at the scene?
- A dart.

73
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,970
Like the kind you
shoot an animal with.

74
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,849
We're getting it analyzed.
And I heard Big Daddy's pissed.

75
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,100
- He's looking for revenge.
- Yeah, well...

76
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,649
hopefully we'll take it out
on Beth's boyfriend.

77
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,150
Maybe a war will drive
that bastard out of hiding.

78
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,280
Damn it. I can't believe
she's actually protecting him.

79
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,900
Never saw that one coming.

80
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,279
- She finally picked someone, huh?
- A total lowlife.

81
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,450
Yeah, well,
we're gonna have to call her in.

82
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,160
Yeah. I figured that.

83
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,160
Listen, I'm supposed
to meet her tomorrow.

84
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:18,869
Give me a crack
at her first, will you?

85
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,459
- I can't do that, O'Neal. You're not...
- Yeah, you can.

86
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,840
You just schedule her
for the day after.

87
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,720
Please.

88
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,840
Come on, Jos�.

89
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,220
You know, I got a better shot
than anyone to get through to her.

90
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,470
- Why is that?
- She watched him almost kill me.

91
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,660
I guess Tohr isn't
showing up tonight.

92
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,900
That's not like him.

93
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,440
I took a piece out of him
when I shouldn't have.

94
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,740
I need to apologize to him.

95
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,780
That'd be a surprise.

96
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,500
- Am I that awful?
- No.

97
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:51,419
- You're just not wrong that often.
- I brought Wellsie into it...

98
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,130
- Shit.
- And how he feels about her.

99
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,270
Why?

100
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,890
- Get out your welcome mat.
- How many?

101
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,600
Three, at least.

102
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,640
Yee-haw.

103
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,320
Evening, boys.

104
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,310
Christ!

105
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,500
We're cool.

106
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,470
You and me,

107
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,760
we've done this before.

108
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,350
You did your thing.

109
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,440
You're fed.

110
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,290
Now...

111
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,580
let's get Rhage back.

112
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,010
Relax, Hollywood. We're good.

113
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,180
You're doing good.

114
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,720
Vishous? We need a car.
I gotta move our boy.

115
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,320
We just had a visit
from the other side.

116
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,100
I hate this.

117
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,600
Yeah. I know.

118
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,400
We're going to get you home.

119
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,320
Didn't like seeing you shot.

120
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,240
Clearly.

121
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,250
All good.

122
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,410
What the fuck do we have here?

123
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,460
My favorite sound in the world.

124
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,380
Admiring my artwork?

125
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,130
You should see the rest of me.

126
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,560
What? Don't you like me?

127
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,980
Think you can run fast enough?

128
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,730
I'm damn sure you can't.

129
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,310
Get away from her, Zsadist.

130
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,320
Time to go, Z.

131
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,980
Not willing to share the female?

132
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,200
You only like it
if you pay for it.

133
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,990
So I'll flip her a 20.

134
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,780
Assuming she lives
through the sex.

135
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,870
You're not touching her.

136
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,370
You're not looking at her.

137
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,340
You're gonna say good night
and walk the fuck out of here.

138
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,170
You're actually willing
to fight for a human?

139
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,460
She's Darius' daughter.

140
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,850
- What's your name?
- Her name's Beth.

141
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,350
And you're leaving.

142
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,600
Yeah. Sure.

143
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,690
Whatever.

144
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,410
Nice to meet you, Beth.

145
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,990
Are you okay?

146
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,130
He didn't touch you, did he?

147
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,000
I heard you scream.

148
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,010
No. No.

149
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,140
He just scared me.
I woke up and he was in the room.

150
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,480
You're hurt. What happened?

151
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,310
It's nothing.

152
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,610
I just have to hold
you for a minute.

153
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I couldn't bear it
if he'd... taken you away from me.

154
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,090
I don't want you
near Z again, ever.

155
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,130
If he walks in the
room, you come find me.

156
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,890
If I'm not around,

157
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,300
you will lock yourself
in these rooms.

158
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,680
The walls are made of steels
so he can't materialize inside.

159
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:59,480
And don't ever touch him.

160
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,150
Not even inadvertently.

161
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,110
Do you understand?

162
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,410
Yes.

163
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,420
Who is he?

164
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,040
And what happened?

165
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,630
Is he a warrior?

166
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,340
He's one of the brothers,

167
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,220
but he's nearly soulless.

168
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,640
He hates everyone,

169
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,350
except for maybe his twin.

170
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,770
Twin?

171
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,060
There are two like him?

172
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,480
Phury.

173
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,900
He's the only one
who can get through to Z,

174
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,980
although even then,
it's not a sure thing.

175
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,280
Zsadist respected your father,

176
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,950
so he may leave you alone.

177
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,910
Just promise me you'll
stay away from him.

178
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,350
Rhage, man, how we feeling?

179
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,640
Belly hurts.

180
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,020
Going home.

181
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,440
Where my clothes?

182
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,770
You lost them.

183
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,530
And you're not leaving.

184
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,650
You're crashing in D's room.

185
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,490
Hey.

186
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,580
We're not waltzing here.

187
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,700
Will you lean on
me, for Christ's sake?

188
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,430
I feel sick.

189
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,520
Indigestion's a bitch.

190
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,770
Do you want some Tums?

191
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,190
Alka-Seltzer?

192
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,410
Hey.

193
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,150
Come here.

194
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,960
Thank you.

195
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,340
Thank you for
caring for my brother.

196
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,100
Wrath?

197
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,770
Who did you lose?

198
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,110
Lose?

199
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,570
Who did the lessers take from you?

200
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,160
My parents.

201
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,010
I'm sorry.

202
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,090
It was before my transition.

203
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,510
A long time ago.

204
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,810
It was winter.

205
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,400
Cold night in February.

206
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,270
We thought as the First Family,

207
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,280
we were safe from the lessers.

208
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,530
Our homes were
well-defended, well hidden,

209
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,580
and we moved all the time.

210
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,620
One of our servants
betrayed our location.

211
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,410
No!

212
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,480
No!

213
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,410
No!

214
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,750
Come on!

215
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,130
No!

216
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,600
No, no.

217
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,890
After they left,

218
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,860
my father tried
to drag himself over to me.

219
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,940
They had stabbed him in the heart.

220
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,200
He gave out two feet from me,

221
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,500
reaching for me.

222
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,630
I was trapped there
for hours with their bodies,

223
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,420
watching the pools
of blood get bigger.

224
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,760
Some civilian vampires

225
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,060
came the following
night and let me out.

226
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,660
Before the lessers left,

227
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,790
they pulled back all the
tapestries from the windows.

228
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,130
The moment the sun rose...

229
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,670
all the bodies burned.

230
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,970
I had nothing to bury.

231
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,250
No crying.

232
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,420
It changes nothing.

233
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,140
I still have dreams
about that night.

234
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,350
I should have been out there
with my father, fighting.

235
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,480
You would have been killed.

236
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,240
As a male should.

237
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,240
Protecting his own.

238
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,740
That's honorable.

239
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:18,099
Maybe you needed to be protected.

240
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,080
No.

241
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,960
A male protects.

242
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,670
Never the other way around.

243
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,930
You still want me?

244
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,220
Why wouldn't I?

245
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,020
My parents, I did
nothing to save them.

246
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,070
You were locked in.

247
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,530
I was a coward.

248
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,670
You were not.

249
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,200
I stopped screaming.

250
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,840
What?

251
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,250
I stopped screaming.

252
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,680
After they were finished
with my parents and the doggen,

253
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,890
I stopped screaming.

254
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,890
The lessers were looking for me.

255
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,730
And I stayed quiet.

256
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,530
I clamped my hand over my mouth.

257
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,160
I prayed they wouldn't find me.

258
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,660
Of course you did.

259
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,920
Of course you did.

260
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,790
You wanted to live.

261
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,390
No.

262
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,220
I was afraid of dying.

263
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,100
- I was a coward.
- Hey.

264
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,390
No, don't be ridiculous!

265
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,280
Hey.

266
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,200
You had just seen
your parents murdered.

267
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,740
You stayed silent
because you wanted to survive.

268
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,620
There's nothing shameful in that.

269
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,540
You were a victim
as much as they were.

270
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,040
The only reason you're alive today is
because your father loved you enough

271
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,380
to keep you safe.

272
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,630
So put down that warrior crap

273
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,630
and give yourself a break.

274
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,030
I'm sorry.

275
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,570
I shouldn't have...

276
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,620
No one has ever spoken to me
as you just did.

277
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,480
Leelan.

278
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,360
Vampire talk for bitch?

279
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,910
Far from it.

280
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,130
Your language is beautiful.

281
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,430
There are no words worthy of you.

282
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,350
You're beautiful.

283
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,060
Warriors are not beautiful.

284
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,570
But you are to me.

285
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,780
You're utterly beautiful.

286
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,850
Where are you going?

287
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,980
Work.

288
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,270
I usually get in around 9:00.

289
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,530
I don't want you to go.

290
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,070
I have a life. I need
to get back to it.

291
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,410
Your life is here.

292
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,250
You're tough, you know that?

293
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,130
Well, I'd better be
if I'm gonna hang around with you.

294
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,970
I want that.

295
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,890
For you to be around.

296
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,610
Really?

297
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,450
Yeah.

298
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,150
It's fucking stupid.

299
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,610
It's crazy. It's...

300
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,570
dangerous.

301
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,830
Well...

302
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,410
then it'll fit
right into your life script.

303
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,130
Yeah, pretty much.

304
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,840
Beth, you have to understand.

305
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,680
You'll be a target...

306
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,260
and I don't know
how to keep you safe.

307
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,600
I don't know how the hell to...

308
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,690
We'll figure it out.

309
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,520
We can do it together.

310
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,290
So you'll stay now?

311
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,510
No.

312
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,970
I really do need to get to work.

313
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,690
You'll be back before dusk.

314
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,780
I'll be back sometime
after sunset.

315
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,240
And I promise to call
if anything weird happens.

316
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,620
I mean, weirder.

317
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,660
I don't like this.

318
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,620
Come on.

319
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,790
I'll be fine.

320
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,760
Only two kills last night.

321
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,970
Your quota was ten.

322
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,470
We couldn't find any.

323
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,930
I found one.

324
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,430
Quite easily, I might add.

325
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,350
Mr. O found two.

326
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,900
Well, the rest of us couldn't.

327
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,480
The numbers in this
area have thinned.

328
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,030
The problem is not geography.

329
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,530
Care to elaborate, Mr. O?

330
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,790
The problem is motivation.

331
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,620
There are no
consequences for failure.

332
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,640
Everyone leave now.

333
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,850
Mr. O, you stay.

334
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:16,200
If you ever pull
anything like that again,

335
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,780
I will turn you over to the Omega.

336
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,160
No, you won't.

337
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,540
You wouldn't wanna look
as if you can't control your men.

338
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,790
Careful, O.

339
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:31,720
You underestimate the
Omega's affection for sacrifices.

340
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,180
If I were to give
you to him as a gift,

341
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,180
he would be most grateful.

342
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,100
He would enjoy unwrapping you,

343
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,890
and I would enjoy watching it.

344
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,560
So mind your manners,

345
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,740
don't ever take out
another member of the society

346
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,740
without my expressed permission,

347
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,410
and we'll get along fine.

348
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,780
Now, what do you say to me?

349
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,670
I can't hear you.

350
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,670
Yes, sensei.

351
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,220
Good boy.

352
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,610
Billy.

353
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,310
How are you, my son?

354
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,140
I just heard about
Butch's suspension.

355
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,520
You think they're gonna fire him?

356
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,520
Off the record? Probably.

357
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,160
I need to bring you in. Another
prostitute was killed last night.

358
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,320
Same MO.

359
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,060
I don't need to tell you
how serious the situation is.

360
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,580
Your man is our prime suspect
in three murders,

361
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:47,789
and obstruction to justice
is a serious charge.

362
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,860
- He did not murder anyone last night.
- So you know where he is?

363
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,960
He did not kill any
of those women.

364
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,510
That's your opinion.

365
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,450
You've been a good friend, Jos�.

366
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,640
Goddamn it.

367
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,600
Get a lawyer, Beth...

368
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,610
and fast.

369
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:37,590
- Thanks for meeting me, sensei.
- Billy, how are you?

370
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,550
I was worried
when I got your call.

371
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,450
And then you didn't
make it to class.

372
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,230
Billy?

373
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,100
Someone's after me, sensei.

374
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,650
Well, I'm glad you
came to me, son.

375
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,910
Talk.

376
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,110
You can trust me.

377
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,490
My dad's in DC as usual.

378
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,910
So last night, I had a few blunts.

379
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,410
You shouldn't do that.

380
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,040
Drugs are bad.

381
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,840
I know.

382
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,800
So my friends and
I are by the pool,

383
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,710
and one wants to hit it
with his girlfriend.

384
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,680
And I gotta go get the key
to the pool house.

385
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,600
When I'm walking back,

386
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,560
a guy steps out in front of me,

387
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,480
like, from out of nowhere.

388
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,650
He was huge. Long black hair,
dressed in leather.

389
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,610
Later.

390
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,400
And he scared the hell out of me.

391
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,700
Looking like he wanted
to have me for lunch.

392
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,580
But my friend calls,

393
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,330
and the guy said my name
and just disappeared.

394
00:38:48,331 --> 00:38:50,869
I don't know how he
got onto the grounds,

395
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,420
what with the walls and security
and everything.

396
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,840
I'm kinda scared, sensei.

397
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,300
You should be.

398
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,590
Tell me something, Billy.

399
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,760
You got a girlfriend?

400
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,310
A couple.

401
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,970
Someone special?

402
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,850
They're good for getting off.

403
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,940
But they're all over me, and I...

404
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,190
Go on, son.

405
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,940
There isn't anything
you can't tell me.

406
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,040
I like them better
when they're hard to get.

407
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,500
Actually...

408
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:38,500
I like it when they're
trying to get away.

409
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,090
You like to catch them?

410
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,760
I like to take them.

411
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,260
You know what I mean?

412
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,810
You ever kill something, Billy?

413
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,850
Birds, squirrels,
maybe a cat or a dog?

414
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,280
Aren't you gonna
answer your sensei?

415
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:03,830
Yeah.

416
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,870
Maybe. When I was younger.

417
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,870
How'd it make you feel?

418
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,580
Nada.

419
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,460
I didn't feel anything.

420
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,050
Okay.

421
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,130
Yeah. Maybe I liked it.

422
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,470
And your father?

423
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,140
Did this concern him?

424
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,720
Who cares what he thinks?

425
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,060
Billy, I know you've run away.

426
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:40,479
I know your father
sent you up to prep school

427
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,280
the minute your mother died.

428
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,150
I know you got
kicked out of there,

429
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,030
kicked out of the next place,

430
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,120
and then pushed
off to military school.

431
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,330
It seems to me
like your father's been trying

432
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,620
to get rid of you
for the past decade.

433
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,300
I hate him.

434
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,010
Why do you hate him, son?

435
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,010
Because he breathes.

436
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,560
Let's eat.

437
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,900
And then I can take you home.

438
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,360
This is Tohr.

439
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,480
I can't take your call right now,
so let me get back to you.

440
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,660
- Yeah?
- We got issues. Another dead prostitute.

441
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,790
In an alley. Bled out.
I hacked the coroner's database.

442
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,670
In both cases, the females
had their necks chewed on.

443
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,840
Shit.

444
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,960
- Zsadist.
- I keep telling him he's gotta pull back.

445
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:30,420
- You have to talk to him.
- Tell the brothers to come here tonight.

446
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,620
I'm going to set him straight
in front of everyone.

447
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,520
You know where Tohr is?

448
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,430
No idea. I'll go to his house

449
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,940
- on my way over to D's if you want.
- Do that.

450
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,860
He needs to be here tonight.

451
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,110
True.

452
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,820
This is Beth Randall
at the Caldwell Courier.

453
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,390
Leave a message after the tone, and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

454
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,920
Beth!

455
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:10,220
Oh, God!

456
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,600
Beth!

457
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,390
Beth! Beth.

458
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,690
Can you hear me?
Beth, can you hear me?

459
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:32,450
Yeah, I got a probable
drug overdose.

460
00:43:32,451 --> 00:43:34,699
Baby, be still. Be still.
I'm gonna take care...

461
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,450
- Take me to Wrath.
- Fuck him. Drug overdose.

462
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,240
- I think it's heroin.
- No, I don't have Narcan!

463
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,870
Wrath, I need to go to Wrath.

464
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,870
- I'm gonna die.
- The hell you are!

465
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,290
I need him.

466
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,210
Goddamn it!

467
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,090
My brothers,
we've got two pieces of business.

468
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,100
I have gravely injured one of you.

469
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,230
Accordingly, I offer
Tohrment the rhythe.

470
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:06,600
In front of these
witnesses, hear me now.

471
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,900
I absolve you of
the repercussions.

472
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,320
Do you accept?

473
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,700
I cannot strike you, my Lord.

474
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,910
And you cannot forgive me.

475
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,410
I cannot blame you.

476
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,490
I will offer again
at another time.

477
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,500
And I will always decline.

478
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,290
Now, Z,

479
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,050
about your goddamn love life,

480
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,420
I want you to chill
it with the whores.

481
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:36,930
Or at the very least,
clean up after yourself.

482
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,640
What are you talking about?

483
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,680
The bodies. The cops found them.

484
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,770
- What bodies?
- Christ, Z.

485
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:47,100
Do you think the cops
are going to let two dead women

486
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:50,650
- left out to bleed in alleys slide?
- I don't know dick about that.

487
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,290
I know you too well
to believe any word you say.

488
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,540
Easy, Z.

489
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:10,290
One of these days,
my Lord, I'm going to...

490
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,760
Goddamn son of a bitch.

491
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,050
- Look what you did to her.
- Nobody kills this human but me.

492
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,890
And he does not leave this house
until I come back.

493
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:28,140
- How would you like to stay for dinner?
- How would you like to be dinner?

494
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,650
Tell me something, boys.

495
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,870
Wear that leather to
turn each other on?

496
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,150
Some kind of dick
thing to you all?

497
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,660
I'd watch your
mouth if I were you.

498
00:45:43,661 --> 00:45:47,079
Why bother when you could keep
an eye on it for me?

499
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,460
- You're gonna kiss me now?
- Okay. Okay.

500
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,040
Back off, Rhage.

501
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,250
Hey. Come on, let's relax.

502
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,260
That's right. We're cool.

503
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,300
- Do yourself a favor and shut the hell up.
- Why?

504
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,190
Blondie's dying to
get his hands on me.

505
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,950
Maybe I find your wife
and do her a couple times.

506
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,280
How's that sound?

507
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,450
I got no woman.

508
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,080
If the chicks won't do you,
what makes you think I'd want to?

509
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,790
I wanted to piss you off.

510
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:30,290
Why'd you wanna do that?

511
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:35,340
If I attacked first, your boys
wouldn't have let us fight.

512
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,770
Would've killed me
before I had a chance at you.

513
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,210
You know what, I'm starting
to like this big dummy.

514
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,810
Pardon me, gentlemen.

515
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:54,020
Dinner will be
served in 15 minutes.

516
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,070
Hey. Are those the spinach crepes

517
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,400
- that I like so much?
- Yes, sir.

518
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,900
Hot damn.

519
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,080
Hey, can I have one of those?

520
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,460
May I ask a favor? If you're
going to bloody the human,

521
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:13,010
would you be good enough
to do it in the backyard?

522
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,500
Let's eat.

523
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,730
Beth.

524
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,690
Beth. Can you hear me?

525
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,270
Damn it.

526
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,030
Zsadist, leave him alone.

527
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,320
Wrath wants the human alive.

528
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,830
I hope you decide to run.

529
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,620
I'd rather hunt you down
than eat dinner with them.

530
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,670
Shit.

531
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,800
No, don't go out there.

532
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:53,020
Well, I'm not gonna hurt you.

533
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,560
How do I know that?

534
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,100
I'm a cop.

535
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:58,860
Not here in official capacity.

536
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,360
No gun, no badge.

537
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,280
He doesn't normally
let your kind around.

538
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:09,450
I'm waiting for a friend.

539
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,500
What's your name?

540
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,290
Marissa.

541
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,920
I'm called Marissa.

542
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:23,420
Butch. Or Brian O'Neal.

543
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,130
People call me Butch though.

544
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,640
What are you looking at?

545
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:38,020
Sorry. You're probably sick of men
gawking at you.

546
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,600
No males look at me.

547
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,610
I find that very hard
to believe because,

548
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,610
man, you're so totally beautiful.

549
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,460
How about I try not to stare? That'd
be good. Look at me not staring.

550
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,030
Not staring at all. Oh, that's a nice
rug. You ever noticed that before?

551
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,170
I'm gonna shut up now before I
make you any more uncomfortable.

552
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,470
I think I like the
way you look at me.

553
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,100
I'm just not used to it.

554
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,720
You cannot be real.

555
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:19,350
Why not?

556
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,020
You just can't.

557
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:26,690
Well, I am.

558
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,910
You mind if I ask you to prove it?

559
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,210
How?

560
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,300
Can I touch your hair?

561
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,360
I can't breathe.

562
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,660
I hate this house.

563
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,850
It's too bad you're on all
those college waiting lists.

564
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:28,050
Might've gotten into one

565
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,590
if my father hadn't forced me
to apply to all those Ivies.

566
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:34,390
So what are you going to do?

567
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,760
He wants me to move out.

568
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,270
Get a job.

569
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:46,690
It's just...
I don't know where I can go.

570
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:51,940
Anyway, thanks, sensei.

571
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:55,200
This was... this was really great.

572
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,830
Billy.

573
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:00,540
Yes, sensei?

574
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,080
What if you came to work for me?

575
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,750
You mean at the academy?

576
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,210
Sort of.

577
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,310
Beth, come on.

578
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,810
Come back to me.

579
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,850
Damn it. Don't you die.

580
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,070
I lo... I love you.

581
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,240
Damn you.

582
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,580
Goddamn you.

583
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,370
Don't you let go.

584
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,260
Beth.

585
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,300
I will not let you go.

586
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,680
I will come after you
before I let you go.

587
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:47,280
